// Stupid webpack-serve does not have --mode option
// See Should --mode be in webpack-serve? https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-serve/issues/44
// You cannot pass webpack options when using webpack-serve
//
// webpack-dev-server is in maintenance mode, yet webpack documentation uses it (https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#using-webpack-dev-server)
// At least you can pass webpack options with it
//
// Stupid webpack has multiple options for production and development modes:
// -p and -d, see https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#shortcuts
// --mode=production and --mode=development, see https://webpack.js.org/concepts/mode/
// Of course -p is not identical to --mode=production => that would be too easy
// -p seems to be a superset of --mode=production
// With -p you get minified CSS, with --mode=production you don't
//
// This guide https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/ explains another way
// to generate a production build using webpack-merge where you TWO webpack.config.js
//
// To complexify things, mini-css-extract-plugin documentation (https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin/#minimizing-for-production) explains that:
// "While webpack 5 is likely to come with a CSS minimizer built-in, with webpack 4 you need to bring your own."
// so what is -p with --optimize-minimize?
// I've compared the Bootstrap .css output with -p and the official bootstrap.min.css => same sizes: 140 kB
//
// WTF

// webpack-dev-server output is bigger than a regular build because it includes a lot of things
